Create a presentation slide showing forward propagation pipeline in "Intuition Machine" style.

Title: "FORWARD PROPAGATION PIPELINE"

Show pipeline as isometric 3D blocks stacked or connected:
[Input] -> [FEM Module] -> [Encoder] -> [Decoder] -> [Output]

Labels for each block:
- Input: "Blood Glucose Data"
- FEM: "Feature Enhancement"
- Encoder: "MOC Attention"
- Decoder: "DAM Fusion"
- Output: "Prediction"

Style - Intuition Machine aesthetic:
- Aged cream background
- Isometric 3D block diagram
- Connecting arrows or pipes between modules
- Technical annotation labels
- Color coding: different colors for each module
- 16:9 landscape orientation
- No slide numbers
