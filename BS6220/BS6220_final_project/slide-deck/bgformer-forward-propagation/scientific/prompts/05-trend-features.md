Create a professional presentation slide about trend feature extraction.

Title: "FEM Module: Trend Features (Eq. 11)"

Content:
Formula: trend(i) = (1-alpha) * SUM(alpha^t * x_{i-t})

Numeric Example (show step by step):
- Parameters: alpha = 0.3
- Input: [120, 125, 130] mg/dL
- Weights: [1, 0.3, 0.09]
- Calculation: 130 + 37.5 + 10.8 = 178.3
- Result: trend = 0.7 * 178.3 = 124.81 mg/dL

Include a small line chart showing raw data vs smoothed trend line.

Style:
- Clean white background
- Formula at top
- Step-by-step calculation in center
- Small chart at bottom right
- Professional academic style
